##  Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Chart**: Use visuals that best represent the data (e.g., bar for comparisons, line for trends).
2. **Avoid Clutter**: Use clean layouts, minimal text, and limit color usage for better focus.
3. **Highlight Key Takeaways**: Use labels, annotations, or color highlights to emphasize critical points.
4. **Add Context**: Include titles, subtitles, and descriptions to make visuals self-explanatory.
5. **Focus on Business Insights**: Don’t just show data—explain what it means for the business.
6. **Create a Summary Slide/Storyboard**: Develop a final page that summarizes key findings and insights in a narrative format.
